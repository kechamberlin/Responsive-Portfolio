            <p class="bio-1">
                My name is Kris Chamberlin.  I am 27-years-old and live in Irvine, California.  
                In June 2019, I graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B. A. in History.
                Currently, I am at UC Irvine doing a Full Stack Web Development boot camp.
                I want to be a web developer because coding is a very in-demand skill employers look for in today's economy.
                Prior to taking the boot camp, I had zero experience with coding.
                However, I have learned a lot within the first week!
            </p>

            <p class="bio-2">
                I live with my wonderful girlfriend Aleah, who I have been with for about a year and a half, and my number one favorite thing to do in the world is make fun memories with her.
            </p>

            <p class="bio-3">
                In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games.  Currently, my favorite games are World of Warcraft: Classic (a high-fantasy MMORPG) and Hearts of Iron IV (a grand strategy World War II simulator).
                Additionally, I aspire to participate in a powerlifting competition,
                poorly play the electric bass,
                and attend concerts of my favorite bands when my bank account allows me to.
                My favorite music genre is heavy metal, and I am absolutely obsessed with Iron Maiden and Metallica.
